# Business Case: Vantage (Real-Time AI Coach)

## The Verdict: YES, Highly Viable.
**Bottom Line:** This is a high-margin "Prosumer SaaS" business if you target the right niche. You can break even with just **1,500 users**.

## 1. The "Unit Economics" (Can we afford to run it?)
Using an optimized tech stack (Deepgram for listening + GPT-4o-mini for thinking), the cost to run the AI is surprisingly low.

| Cost Component | Cost per Hour of Meeting |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Listening (Deepgram Nova-2)** | $0.35 |
| **Thinking (LLM Tokenization)** | ~$0.15 |
| **Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** | **$0.50 per hour** |

### Profit Margin Scenario
*   **Price:** $39/month (Pro user)
*   **Avg Usage:** 40 hours of meetings/month
*   **Cost to Serve:** $20.00/month
*   **Gross Profit:** **$19.00 per user (48% Margin)**
*   *Note: Casual users (20 hrs/mo) yield a 74% margin ($29/user).*

## 2. The Market Size (Who buys this?)
We are ignoring Salespeople (Red Ocean). We are targeting "Professional Negotiators."

| Target Persona | Est. US Population | Pain Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Procurement Managers** | 522,000 | Saving company money = their bonus. |
| **Project Managers (PMP)** | 400,000 | Negotiating scope creep daily. |
| **Freelancers/Agencies** | 4,200,000 | Negotiating rates is their livelihood. |
| **Total Addressable Market** | **~5.1 Million Professionals** | |

## 3. The "Unicorn" Math
*   **Capture 1% of the Market:** 51,000 Users
*   **Price:** $39/month
*   **Annual Revenue:** **$23.8 Million ARR**

## 4. Why it works now
*   **The "CFO" Factor:** Companies are tightening budgets. Procurement teams are under pressure to negotiate harder. A tool that says *"Hey, supplier X is bluffing, ask for 5% off"* pays for itself in one meeting.
*   **The "Remote" Normal:** 90% of these negotiations now happen on Zoom/Teams, where an AI overlay is natural (unlike in-person meetings).

## Recommendation
**Build the "Efficient Stack" ($0.50/hr cost), NOT the "OpenAI Realtime" stack ($18/hr cost).**
Start by targeting **Freelancers & Agency Owners**. They feel the pain of negotiation most acutely (it's their own money) and have the fastest buying cycle.
